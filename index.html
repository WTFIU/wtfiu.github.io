    <section>
      <p><strong>wtfiu</strong> is a space for creative digital experiments — a small universe where code, art, and imagination collide. Every pixel here has a purpose, every animation is intentional, and every project is built to explore how technology can express creativity. This site evolves constantly, serving as a playground for web concepts, design experiments, and coding ideas that might not fit anywhere else.</p>

      <p>The goal is simple: to build things that make you curious. From glowing gradients and smooth motion to interactive JavaScript utilities, <strong>wtfiu</strong> mixes fun with function. Some projects you’ll find here are purely visual — light trails, color pulses, and playful illusions. Others are tools that help automate or enhance small everyday tasks, made with a sense of experimentation rather than perfection.</p>

      <p>This site is also a learning log — every experiment adds something new, whether it’s mastering CSS animations, exploring APIs, or testing how web performance changes under creative pressure. Each project here started with a single question: “What if…?” That question fuels everything on <strong>wtfiu</strong>.</p>

      <p>Beyond aesthetics, there’s intent: building a place that encourages curiosity, creativity, and discovery. Visitors can expect occasional updates — sometimes a new idea, sometimes a full release, sometimes a hidden concept page. The site’s tone is minimal but alive, glowing with motion and depth while staying simple enough to navigate intuitively.</p>

      <p><strong>wtfiu</strong> is not about trends or clicks — it’s about exploration. It’s a reminder that the web can still be weird, beautiful, and experimental all at once. Every page here exists as an invitation to imagine and to build. Whether you’re here to get inspired, to learn, or to simply watch light move across a dark screen, you’re part of the creative process that keeps this world expanding.</p>

      <p>
  In addition to experimenting with code and visuals, <strong>wtfiu</strong> is a place to explore ideas that blur the line between technology and art. 
  Each project here is a reflection of curiosity — an attempt to turn a simple concept into an engaging experience. 
  Some visitors might see just animations or colors, while others will notice patterns, interactive behaviors, or hidden surprises embedded in the code. 
  This layered approach encourages repeated visits and exploration, rewarding those who look closely or interact deeply with the site.
</p>

<p>
  Collaboration is always welcome. While most projects are solo creations, there’s room for input from other creative minds who want to experiment with web design, scripting, or interactivity. 
  Feedback helps these experiments evolve and grow, and sometimes sparks entirely new ideas that wouldn’t exist without it. 
  Whether you’re a coder, designer, or simply someone who enjoys the unexpected, <strong>wtfiu</strong> aims to inspire creativity and curiosity.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, <strong>wtfiu</strong> reflects the idea that the web itself is still a canvas — a playground where imagination and logic coexist. 
  By combining visual aesthetics, interactive tools, and small experiments, the site demonstrates how code can be both functional and expressive. 
  Every update, no matter how small, adds to the story of exploration that <strong>wtfiu</strong> represents. 
  Visitors can expect a dynamic experience that evolves with each visit, offering something new to discover or play with every time.
